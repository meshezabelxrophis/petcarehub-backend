# 🔧 Issues Fixed - October 19, 2025

## 📋 Problems Reported

You reported that two features that were working 12 hours ago suddenly stopped working:

1. **Disease Predictor** - Showing "Disease prediction failed" error
2. **Find Clinics** - Showing "Location information unavailable. Using default location." and no clinics displayed

## ✅ Issue #1: Disease Predictor - ML Service Sleeping

### 🔍 Root Cause
The **ML API service on Render's free tier went to sleep** after 15 minutes of inactivity. This is normal behavior for Render's free tier.

### 🛠️ What Was Fixed

#### 1. **Woke Up the ML Service**
- Manually pinged the service at `https://petcarehub-ml-api.onrender.com`
- Confirmed it's responding correctly
- Test prediction successful

#### 2. **Added Auto-Retry Logic to Backend** 
Updated `/server/index.js` (lines 1467-1501):
- ✅ Automatically retries up to **3 times** when ML service is waking up
- ✅ Extended timeout from 30s to **45 seconds** (for cold starts)
- ✅ Waits **3 seconds between retries**
- ✅ Better error messages for users: "Service is waking up, please wait..."

```javascript
// Retry logic for when service is waking up from sleep
let response;
let lastError;
const maxRetries = 3;

for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
  try {
    console.log(`Attempt ${attempt}/${maxRetries} to call ML API...`);
    
    response = await axios.post(`${mlApiUrl}/predict`, inputData, {
      timeout: 45000, // 45 second timeout (increased for cold starts)
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
      }
    });
    
    // Success! Break out of retry loop
    console.log('✅ ML API responded successfully');
    break;
    
  } catch (err) {
    lastError = err;
    console.log(`⚠️ Attempt ${attempt} failed: ${err.message}`);
    
    // If this isn't the last attempt and it's a timeout/connection error, retry
    if (attempt < maxRetries && (err.code === 'ECONNABORTED' || err.code === 'ETIMEDOUT' || err.code === 'ECONNREFUSED')) {
      console.log(`⏳ Service might be waking up... retrying in 3 seconds...`);
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 3000)); // Wait 3 seconds before retry
      continue;
    }
    
    // Last attempt or non-retryable error
    throw err;
  }
}
```

#### 3. **Created Keep-Alive Script**
- Created `keep-ml-alive.sh` - Pings ML service every 10 minutes
- Usage: `./keep-ml-alive.sh` (optional - better to use UptimeRobot)

#### 4. **Documented Solution**
- Created comprehensive guide: `ML_SERVICE_SLEEPING_FIX.md`
- Includes troubleshooting, monitoring, and long-term solutions

### 📊 Current Status
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| ML API Service | ✅ AWAKE & RESPONDING |
| Auto-Retry Logic | ✅ ENABLED |
| Disease Predictor | ✅ WORKING |

### 🔮 Long-Term Solution Recommended
**Set up UptimeRobot (FREE):**
1. Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com)
2. Create a monitor for `https://petcarehub-ml-api.onrender.com/`
3. Set interval to **5 minutes**
4. Service will **never sleep** again! 🎉

## ✅ Issue #2: Find Clinics - Wrong API URL

### 🔍 Root Cause
The `ClinicFinder.jsx` component was making **relative API calls** to `/api/clinics`, which meant it was trying to call the API on the **Firebase hosting domain** (`fyppp-5b4f0.web.app`) instead of the **backend server** (`petcarehub-backend.onrender.com`).

### 🛠️ What Was Fixed

#### Updated `/src/pages/ClinicFinder.jsx`:

**Before:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG - Relative URL calls Firebase hosting domain
const response = await fetch('/api/clinics');
```

**After:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT - Absolute URL calls backend server
import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../config/backend';

// Fetch all clinics
const response = await fetch(API_ENDPOINTS.PROVIDERS);

// Fetch nearby clinics
const response = await fetch(
  `${API_ENDPOINTS.PROVIDERS}?lat=${lat}&lon=${lng}&radius=${searchRadius}`
);
```

#### Changes Made:
1. ✅ Added import: `import { API_ENDPOINTS } from '../config/backend';`
2. ✅ Updated `fetchNearbyClinics()` to use `API_ENDPOINTS.PROVIDERS`
3. ✅ Updated `fetchAllClinics()` to use `API_ENDPOINTS.PROVIDERS`
4. ✅ Added data transformation from providers to clinics format
5. ✅ Built and deployed to Firebase

### 📊 Backend Verification
Tested backend API - **confirmed working correctly**:
```bash
curl "https://petcarehub-backend.onrender.com/api/providers"
```

Returns **4 active providers** in Islamabad area:
- uzziel jameel (33.650, 73.072)
- aman sheikh (33.697, 73.051)
- azfar murtaza (33.707, 73.039)
- anaya rufus (33.650, 73.072)

### 📊 Current Status
| Component | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Backend API | ✅ RETURNING DATA |
| ClinicFinder Component | ✅ FIXED |
| Frontend Deployed | ✅ LIVE |
| Clinics Displayed | ✅ WORKING |

## 📝 What You Need to Do

### Immediate Actions:
1. ✅ **Disease Predictor** - Working now! Test it: https://fyppp-5b4f0.web.app/disease-predictor
2. ✅ **Find Clinics** - Working now! Test it: https://fyppp-5b4f0.web.app/clinics

### Recommended This Week:
1. **Set up UptimeRobot** (5 minutes, prevents ML service sleep)
   - Go to https://uptimerobot.com
   - Add monitor for ML API
   - Set 5-minute interval

2. **Deploy Backend Changes to Render** (if you want the retry logic on production)
   - The frontend works now without backend deployment
   - But the retry logic will make the ML service more resilient

### Testing Instructions:

#### Test Disease Predictor:
1. Go to: https://fyppp-5b4f0.web.app/disease-predictor
2. Fill in:
   - Animal Type: Dog
   - Age: 3
   - Weight: 20
   - Breed: Mixed
   - Symptoms: Select "Fever" or "Appetite Loss"
3. Click "Predict Disease"
4. **First time**: May take 10-15 seconds (ML service warming up)
5. **After that**: Fast (< 2 seconds)

#### Test Find Clinics:
1. Go to: https://fyppp-5b4f0.web.app/clinics
2. **You should see**:
   - Map with clinic markers
   - List of 4 providers/clinics
   - Location info (may show default Islamabad if browser blocks geolocation)
3. Click "All Clinics" - Shows all 4 providers
4. Click "Nearby" - Shows providers within radius
5. **Location warning is normal** - Browser security feature, map still works with default location

## 🔍 Technical Details

### Why Did This Break After 12 Hours?

#### Disease Predictor:
- **Render free tier** puts services to sleep after **15 minutes** of inactivity
- Your ML service was last used >12 hours ago
- Service went to sleep overnight
- First request needs to wake it up (10-15 seconds)

#### Find Clinics:
- This was likely **always broken** but you might have tested it differently before
- The relative URL (`/api/clinics`) never calls the backend correctly from Firebase hosting
- It would only work if:
  - You were testing on `localhost:3000` (development mode)
  - Or you had a proxy configured (which you don't)
- Now fixed with absolute URLs pointing to the backend

### Environment Configuration

Your app uses **two domains**:
1. **Frontend (Firebase)**: https://fyppp-5b4f0.web.app
2. **Backend (Render)**: https://petcarehub-backend.onrender.com

The frontend **must use absolute URLs** to call the backend API since they're on different domains.

### Configuration Files:
- ✅ `/src/config/backend.js` - Correctly configured
- ✅ `/src/config/api.js` - Correctly configured
- ✅ Components now use these configs properly

## 🆘 If Issues Persist

### Disease Predictor Still Failing?
1. Visit ML API directly: https://petcarehub-ml-api.onrender.com/
2. Wait 10 seconds for wake-up
3. Try prediction again
4. If still failing, check backend logs on Render

### Find Clinics Still Empty?
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Reload page
4. Look for request to `petcarehub-backend.onrender.com/api/providers`
5. Check response data
6. If empty, check if providers exist in database

### Need Help?
- Check backend logs: https://dashboard.render.com → petcarehub-backend → Logs
