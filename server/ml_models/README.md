## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r ml_requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
- scikit-learn >= 1.3.0
- pandas >= 2.0.0
- numpy >= 1.24.0
- matplotlib >= 3.7.0
- seaborn >= 0.12.0
- joblib >= 1.3.0

### 2. Train the Model

```bash
python3 train_model.py
```

This will:
- Load and analyze the dataset (`animal_disease_prediction.csv`)
- Preprocess the data (handle missing values, encode categories)
- Train a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluate performance with accuracy and confusion matrix
- Save the trained model as `disease_model.pkl`

### 3. Make Predictions

**Basic Prediction:**
```bash
python3 predict_disease.py
```

**Enhanced Prediction with Severity Assessment:**
```bash
python3 enhanced_prediction_demo.py
```

**Programmatic Usage:**

Basic prediction:
```python
from predict_disease import DiseasePredictor

predictor = DiseasePredictor()
result = predictor.predict(animal_data)
print(f"Disease: {result['predicted_disease']} ({result['confidence']})")
```

Enhanced prediction with severity:
```python
from severity_utils import EnhancedDiseasePredictor

predictor = EnhancedDiseasePredictor()
result = predictor.predict_with_severity(animal_data)

print(f"Disease: {result['predicted_disease']}")
print(f"Severity: {result['severity']['level']}")
print(f"Urgency: {result['severity']['urgency']}")
print(f"Recommendation: {result['severity']['recommendation']}")
```

- **Heart_Rate**: Heart rate (beats per minute)

### Symptoms

## üéØ Supported Diseases

The model can predict 52 different animal diseases, including:

**Common Diseases:**
- Parvovirus (Dogs)
- Upper Respiratory Infection (Cats)
- Bovine Respiratory Disease (Cattle)
- Equine Influenza (Horses)
- Gastroenteritis
- Pneumonia
- Mastitis

**And many more...**

## üè• Severity Mapping System

The system includes comprehensive severity assessments for all 52 diseases:

### Severity Levels
- **üî¥ Severe (30 diseases)**: Life-threatening conditions requiring immediate attention
- **üü° Moderate (18 diseases)**: Conditions requiring veterinary care within 24-48 hours  
- **üü¢ Mild (4 diseases)**: Conditions that may resolve with monitoring and supportive care

### Urgency Classifications
- **üö® Emergency (27 diseases)**: Immediate veterinary attention required
- **üü† High (11 diseases)**: Veterinary care needed within 24 hours
- **üü° Medium (10 diseases)**: Veterinary consultation within 2-3 days
- **üü¢ Low (4 diseases)**: Monitor symptoms, contact vet if worsening

### Example Severity Mappings

```json
{
  "Parvovirus": {
    "severity": "Severe",
    "urgency": "Emergency", 
    "recommendation": "Take your pet to the nearest emergency clinic immediately. Parvovirus can be fatal within hours."
  },
  "Kennel Cough": {
    "severity": "Mild",
    "urgency": "Low",
    "recommendation": "Symptoms may resolve in 1-2 weeks with rest. Contact your veterinarian if coughing persists or worsens."
  },
  "Upper Respiratory Infection": {
    "severity": "Mild", 
    "urgency": "Low",
    "recommendation": "Monitor symptoms for 3-5 days. If they worsen or persist beyond a week, contact your veterinarian."
  }
}
```

### Adding New Diseases

The severity mapping system is designed to be easily extensible:

```python
from severity_utils import SeverityMapper

mapper = SeverityMapper()
mapper.add_disease("New Disease", {
    "severity": "Moderate",
    "urgency": "Medium",
    "recommendation": "Schedule veterinary visit within 2-3 days.",
    "description": "Description of the new disease",
    "typical_animals": ["Dog", "Cat"]
})
mapper.save_mapping()
```

## üìà Feature Importance

Top 10 most important features for disease prediction:

1. **Weight** (13.9%)
2. **Heart_Rate** (11.8%)
3. **Animal_Type** (10.6%)
4. **Breed** (8.4%)
5. **Age** (6.6%)
6. **Symptom_1** (6.5%)
7. **Body_Temperature** (5.9%)
8. **Symptom_2** (5.0%)
9. **Symptom_3** (4.4%)
10. **Duration** (4.2%)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### Model Limitations
- **Test accuracy is 33.33%** - This indicates the model may overfit to training data
- The model should be used as a **diagnostic aid**, not a replacement for veterinary expertise
- Always consult with a qualified veterinarian for accurate diagnosis

### Data Quality
- The model was trained on 314 samples after removing rare diseases
- Some disease classes had very few samples, which may affect prediction quality
- Real-world performance may vary from training metrics

### Recommendations for Improvement
1. **Collect more data** - Especially for rare diseases
2. **Feature engineering** - Add more clinical indicators
3. **Cross-validation** - Use k-fold CV for better evaluation
4. **Ensemble methods** - Combine multiple models
5. **Regular retraining** - Update model with new data

## üîß Technical Details

### Preprocessing Pipeline
1. **Missing Value Handling**: 
   - Categorical: Mode imputation
   - Numerical: Median imputation
2. **Feature Encoding**:
   - Label encoding for categorical variables
   - Temperature parsing (extract numerical value)
3. **Rare Class Removal**: 
   - Remove diseases with < 3 samples for better stratification

### Model Configuration
```python
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=100,
    max_depth=15,
    min_samples_split=5,
    min_samples_leaf=2,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
)
```

## üìû Integration with PetCareHub

This ML system can be integrated into the PetCareHub platform to provide:

1. **Symptom Checker**: Help pet owners identify potential issues with severity assessment
2. **Veterinary Decision Support**: Assist vets with preliminary diagnoses and urgency levels
3. **Emergency Triage**: Prioritize cases based on predicted severity and urgency
4. **Health Monitoring**: Track pet health trends over time with risk assessment

### API Integration Example

```python
# In your Flask/Express API
from severity_utils import EnhancedDiseasePredictor

@app.route('/api/predict-disease', methods=['POST'])
def predict_disease():
    data = request.json
    predictor = EnhancedDiseasePredictor()
    result = predictor.predict_with_severity(data)
    
    # Enhanced response with severity info
    return jsonify({
        'prediction': result['predicted_disease'],
        'confidence': result['confidence'],
        'severity': result['severity']['level'],
        'urgency': result['severity']['urgency'],
        'recommendation': result['severity']['recommendation'],
        'alternatives': result['top_predictions']
    })
```

### Frontend Integration

```javascript
// Example frontend usage
const predictDisease = async (animalData) => {
  const response = await fetch('/api/predict-disease', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify(animalData)
  });
  
  const result = await response.json();
  
  // Display severity-based UI
  if (result.urgency === 'Emergency') {
    showEmergencyAlert(result.recommendation);
  } else if (result.urgency === 'High') {
    showUrgentNotification(result.recommendation);
  } else {
    showGeneralAdvice(result.recommendation);
  }
};
```
