## 🔑 How to Log In

Since passwords couldn't be migrated from SQLite to Firebase, **all users need to reset their passwords** first.

### Option 1: Use the "Forgot Password" Link (Easiest)

1. Go to the login page: `http://localhost:3000/login`
2. Click **"Forgot your password?"**
3. Enter your email (e.g., `mesh@gmail.com`)
4. Click **"Send reset link"**
5. Check your email for the reset link
6. Click the link and set a new password
7. Return to login and sign in with your new password

### Option 2: Use Direct Password Reset Link

For **mesh@gmail.com**, use this direct link:

```
https://fyppp-5b4f0.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/action?mode=resetPassword&oobCode=tOrgMiAP0LMjTjMpV5izCcuCAB_CGHyrLAxB5NGIJ6YAAAGZ7s64DA&apiKey=AIzaSyDhnIYqPmw8bOk6EnqAh9LPVsaN0EOx2bM&lang=en
```

**Note:** This link expires after some time. If it doesn't work, use Option 1 instead.

## 🆕 New User Registration

New users can sign up directly:

1. Go to: `http://localhost:3000/signup`
2. Fill in the registration form
3. Choose account type (Pet Owner or Service Provider)
4. Click "Sign Up"
5. Account will be created in Firebase Authentication + Firestore

---

## 📊 What Happened During Migration

### Before (SQLite)
- **Authentication + Data** stored together in SQLite database
- Passwords were hashed and stored in the `users` table

### After (Firebase)
- **Authentication** managed by Firebase Auth (email/password)
- **User Data** stored in Firestore (name, role, profile, etc.)
- **Passwords** stored securely by Firebase (can't be migrated from SQLite)

### Migration Process
1. ✅ User profile data → Migrated to Firestore
2. ✅ User accounts → Created in Firebase Auth
3. ❌ Passwords → Cannot be migrated (security feature)
4. ✅ Password reset links → Generated for all users

## 🚀 Testing the Login

### Test with `mesh@gmail.com`:

1. **First time after migration:**
   ```
   ❌ Old password won't work
   ✅ Must reset password first
   ```

2. **After password reset:**
   ```
   ✅ Can log in normally
   ✅ All data is preserved
   ✅ Profile, pets, bookings intact
   ```

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why can't I use my old password?**  
A: Firebase uses a different password hashing system than SQLite. For security reasons, passwords cannot be migrated directly.

**Q: Will I lose my data?**  
A: No! All your data (profile, pets, bookings, services) was migrated to Firestore and is safe.

**Q: Do I need to reset my password every time?**  
A: No, only once. After resetting, you can use your new password normally.

**Q: Can I sign up as a new user?**  
A: Yes! New users can sign up directly without any issues.

**Q: What if the reset link doesn't work?**  
A: Use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to generate a new reset link.
